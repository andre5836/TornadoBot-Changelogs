# Warning from TornadoBot: What does it mean?

Have you recently received a warning from TornadoBot stating that you have been warned by a staff member? Don't worry, this message simply means that you have violated the bot's rules. This warning is intended to alert you to misconduct and give you an opportunity for self-reflection and improvement.

## What exactly does a warning mean?

A warning from TornadoBot is typically triggered when another user has reported you for a rule violation. This could be for various reasons, such as using offensive language, spamming, inappropriate behavior, or other breaches of server policies.

## Consequences of repeated warnings:

Repeated warnings can have serious consequences. If you continue to violate the rules despite the warnings, TornadoBot may suspend your account. Therefore, it is important to take the warnings seriously and adjust your behavior accordingly to avoid further action.

## Types of bans by TornadoBot:

TornadoBot can impose two types of bans: Server Bans and User Bans.

### Server Ban:

A server ban means that all users except the TornadoBot team can no longer execute TornadoBot commands on the server. This type of ban can significantly impact the functionality and interaction within the server and should be avoided.

### User Ban:

With a user ban, the affected member can no longer use TornadoBot commands. This ban remains in place until it is lifted by a TornadoBot staff member or until it expires automatically. It is important to note that respecting the rules of the server is crucial to avoid a user ban and regain unrestricted access.
