## Bot Ban System

1. **Procedure for Bot Bans**: The process for bot bans in TornadoBot is a structured one designed to ensure fair treatment of all users. When a member reports another, a thorough internal review is conducted, considering both the reported user and the reporting member. This review follows established guidelines and procedures to ensure all decisions are transparent, fair, and consistent. Upon completion of the review, appropriate actions are taken, ranging from a warning to a bot ban, depending on the severity of the violation and the circumstances of the incident.

2. **Reasons for Bot Bans**: There are a variety of reasons why a user may be banned from TornadoBot. These include insults, spamming, exploiting errors, inappropriate behavior, attempts to overload or disrupt the bot, and other violations of server rules or the bot's terms of service. Each violation is assessed individually, and the type of action taken is based on the severity of the violation and the circumstances of the incident.

3. **Guidelines for Bot Bans**: Although specific guidelines for bot bans are not currently in place, all decisions are made in accordance with the general server rules and the bot's terms of service. The development of clear guidelines for bot bans may be considered in the future to further standardize and improve the process.

4. **Complaint Procedure**: Users have the right to appeal a bot ban through the support server. All complaints are carefully and internally handled to ensure that all parties involved are heard fairly and that decisions are made on a solid basis. This complaint procedure aims to strengthen transparency and trust in the bot ban system and ensure that users have the opportunity to defend themselves against unjust bans.

5. **Examples and Case Studies**: While specific examples are not currently available, the reasons for bot bans outlined in point 2 can be considered as examples. Case studies can also be used to illustrate specific scenarios and demonstrate the impact of bot bans on the server community. These examples and case studies can help deepen understanding of how the bot ban system works and inform users about the consequences of certain behaviors.

6. **User Responsibilities**: By using TornadoBot, users automatically agree to the terms of service outlined in the Terms and Conditions or the bot's terms of service. Users have a responsibility to ensure that they use the bot in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations. This includes avoiding behaviors that could lead to a bot ban and being willing to cooperate with administrators to resolve issues and support the server community.
