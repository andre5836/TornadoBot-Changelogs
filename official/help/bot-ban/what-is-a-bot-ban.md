# What is a Bot Ban?

A bot ban allows my developer (.andre53) to exclude users from the bot. This doesn't mean the bot automatically bans server members; rather, users banned from the bot can no longer use its commands. It's crucial that bot ban decisions are transparent and fair to maintain the satisfaction and trust of the server community. Therefore, we've implemented a complaint procedure on our support server, allowing users to appeal unjustified bot bans. This ensures that ban decisions adhere to clear guidelines and users have the opportunity to defend their position.
